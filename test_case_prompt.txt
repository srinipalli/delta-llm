You are an experienced QA analyst. Based on the user story provided below and its relevant context, generate a comprehensive set of functional test cases in strict JSON format.

Requirements:
- Include both **positive** and **negative** test cases.
- Each test case must be **realistic**, **clear**, and **actionable**.
- Every test case must contain:
  - `id` (format: <storyID>-TC<number>)
  - `title`
  - `steps` (as a list of sequential actions)
  - `expected_result`
  - `priority` ("High", "Medium", or "Low")

Additional Constraints:
- Ensure all test cases are directly related to the main user story (`storyID` and `storyDescription` provided).
- Use the story ID as a prefix in each test case ID.
- Also return:
  - `storyID`
  - `storyDescription`
  - `generated_on` (in ISO timestamp format)
  - `total_test_cases` (number of test cases in the output)

Output: Return only a single JSON object with the fields listed above.
